\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Relay catalysis}

Traditional catalytic model refers to one catalyst catalysing one reaction, 
synthesizing the target product through step by step synthesis in a linear fashion.
However, mordern organic synthesis advocates atomic economy and economy of steps.
Relay catalysis can combine multiple catalysts to achieve a one-pot tandem reaction,
which can dramatically reduce waste, solvents, time, labor, etc. And can be well controled, 
this is a perfect way to synthesize compound we want.It is more in line with green 
chemistry guidelines and modern organic synthesis 
requirements. Therefore, relay catalysis is an important method for the fabrication of key chemicals
such as ethanol and formaldehyde.Nevertheless, the current implementation of 
relay catalysis, such as the selection of synthesis pathways from syngas to ethanol, 
remains in the traditional paradigm of a time-consuming and labour-intensive manual 
search for reactions based on experience and extensive literature reading.Therefore, 
we would like to have a reaction database, storing a large amount of reaction information, 
which can support us to implement functions such as synthesis path design and selection, 
help us to find a high-selectivity and low-energy relay catalysis pathway to obtain the target product, 
which can be automated or semi-automated to reduce human labour.

\subsection{Reaction database}
To this end, we investigated existing reaction databases(Fig \ref{ Fig.1 }) and found that they 
all focused on the storage of organic reactions and were mostly manually constructed and not easily
accessible for commercial or other reasons.
In addition to this, Pistachio and the USPTO dataset are derived from patent data 
and do not have real-time effects, while Scifinder and Reaxys store reaction information in 
an unstructured manner, besides, the above databases all store reactions in a relational database 
which does not have inference capabilities.Therefore, the construction of a database of 
relay-catalyzed reactions became necessary.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Knowledge graph}

In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, the knowledge graph has gradually 
attracted our attention.It is a multivariate relational graph where nodes represent entities and 
edges represent relationships between entities. In a knowledge graph, a triple is used to represent a 
fact such as Einstein was born in the German Empire in a subject-verb-object structure, and then 
these triples are associated in the form of a graph to form the structure of the graph(Fig \ref{ Fig.2 }). 
In recent years it has also been used in materials science to assist in materials design, 
so we choose the knowledge graph as the underlying data structure for the Relay Catalysis database 
and aim to build a knowledge base of reactions in conjunction with Relay Catalysis.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/2.png}
 \caption{ An example of knowledge graph }
 \label{ Fig.2 }
\end{figure}

To construct such a knowledge graph, we can broadly divide the graph into a schema, which 
describes the concepts in the domain and the relationships between these concepts, e.g. 
redox reactions are a subclass of reactions, such data patterns are generally stored and 
managed by an ontology library, and a data layer, which stores specific data such as the 
product of react:face is acetophenone(Fig \ref{ Fig.3 }). The construction of the data layer actually 
corresponds to the extraction of reaction information, and the pattern layer corresponds 
to the construction of the ontology.

\section{Related work}

\subsection{Entity recognition}
The first and most important step of extracting reaction information from text is chemical entity recognition.
Daniel Lowe proposed rule-based method to extract chemical name from text, which result in low accuracy chemical
information.Jiang Guo proposed NLP method to extract product from text, which needs to label phrases of text. 
Matthew C. Swain proposed a toolkit to unsupervisely extract chemical names from text.

\subsection{Reaction extraction}
Daniel Lowe download patent data from USPTO as an extraction source and use machine learning and rule-based 
methods to extract reaction information into a representation containing atomic position information, 
but this approach has two shortcomings, one being that the patent data does not provide a good picture 
of trends in the field of chemical synthesis, and the rule-based extraction of reactions results in 
low accuracy and low recall information.

To solve these two problems Regina Barzelay's team at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory published a work 
in 2021 that structured the reaction information into eight fields inlcuding product, reaction type, reactant, solvent, etc. Using a 
natural language processing approach, the reaction information extraction process was divided into two parts, entity identification tasks
with reaction products as a central element and other elements that will be related to the product and do the relation extraction task.
Implementing the conversion of a piece of text into a structured response message.For such work, it costs tens of students to label sentences
from articles, spend more than 200 hours to label and check accuracy of labeling work, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Weiren Wang proposed a natural language processing pipeline to capture both chemical composition and property data from articles that allows analysis
and prediction of superalloys.It use a heuristic text multiple-relation extraction distancebased algorithm to get properties without any labeled samples.
which can easily solve the above problem.

\subsection{Atom-Atom mapping}
For applications like verifying the correctness of a reaction, template-based reaction prediction, 
retrosynthesis planning methods, reactant-reagent role assignments, reaction rules extraction and knowledge
extraction from reaction databases. To verify the correctness of a reaction refers to a reaction must have 
at least one product and two reactants/solvents/catalysts,reactants and products do not have the same structures,
for a correct reaction, all atoms of the product must come from the reactants and the number of atoms of the
reactants and the number of atoms of the products should be the same in the calculation.After the information on 
the reaction has been correctly extracted, in order to be able to achieve the above applications.It is necessary
to know how atoms are converted during a reaction, a process we call atomic mapping.To automate this process, 
IBM's European Research Institute Philip's team co-sourced the atomic mapping tool called RXNMapper 
in 2021.Supports the conversion of Smiles representation into Smiles representation with 
corresponding atomic positions, and atomic mapping for different types of reactions, 
with a combined mapping accuracy of 99.4%.

\subsection{Ontology construction}
Ontologies are used to define concepts in a particular domain and the relationships between concepts. They serve two purposes: to constrain 
the data and to facilitate knowledge graph queries.Since the various compounds in chemistry are more clearly defined and related to each other.
Ontologies can be built in a top-down seven-step process(Fig \ref{ Fig.4 }), which is simply divided 
into reusing existing ontologies and building custom ontologies using build tools.

 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/4.png}

 \label{ Fig.4 }
\end{figure}

ChEBI is a database of compounds published in 2007 by the Institute of Bioinformatics-Kirill team at the University of Cambridge that 
describes small molecule compounds in biochemistry using standard bioinformatics terminology, providing compound names, structures, 
descriptors and ontology information.Here is the ontological structure of cobalt in CHEBI and the relationship between a cobalt atom, 
a metal atom, and a metal atom.Due to its organic and inorganic content and clear structure, the ZOOMA tool provides the possibility 
of converting chemical names in the text into ontology corresponding categories to be used as the basic ontology of the catalytic 
knowledge base in relation to specific data.For categories that cannot be represented by the basic ontology, the semi-automated ontology 
building tool Protege can be used to build the relevant concepts and relationships on its own, thus completing the construction of the 
schema layer.

\section{work foundation}
In order to build the Relay Catalytic Knowledge Map, the following preparations have been made.

\subsection{Schema design}
A catalytic reaction message is expressed as 30 fields containing reactants, products, catalysts, reaction conditions, etc(Fig \ref{ Fig.5 }). as follows:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/5.png}
 \caption{ Schema of one reaction }
 \label{ Fig.5 }
\end{figure}
\subsection{Article collection}
A total of over 10,000 papers were then collected using these keywords from the following publishers' journals(Fig \ref{ Fig.6 }).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/6.png}
 \caption{ Number of Articles per Journal in Our Corpus }
 \label{ Fig.6 }
\end{figure}
\subsection{Reaction extraction}
To extract reactions from articles, we try to divide the extraction task into two parts, one is reaction extraction from text, 
another is reaction extraction from tables.To achieve reaction extraction from text, we first need to know if current paragraph
contains the target reaction information or not.
% 训练词向量
we try to use the total 12303 articles to train word vector preparing for text classification.
% 尝试段落分类
Use trained word vector to get paragraph text vector and apply to SVM, Random Forest method to classify paragraph.
% 尝试规则提取化合物与属性
If current paragraph contains the target reaction information, then input it into rule-based or NLP method to extract
chemicals and properties.
% 尝试表格提取化合物及属性
Tables as semi-structured data, can be easily extracted from articles.we use Beautifulsoup to extract tables in articles as lists,
then use tailored algorithms to extract reaction information from these lists. 
After extraction from text and tables, we can combine these information to make reaction complete.

\section{summary}
We plan to automate the process of extracting information from documents to structured reactions(Fig \ref{ Fig.7 }), 
converting the structured information into a knowledge graph through existing tools. It is hoped that such knowledge 
mapping can be applied to scenarios such as synthesis path
selection, reaction result prediction, reaction innovation, checking the correctness of reactions, and experimental condition screening.

The current research work has several challenges, based on the fragmentation of information, the need to do document-level information 
integration, and the need to map referents to specific entities. Some attributes appear in sentences in the form of phrases that cannot 
be simply extracted by rules, and need to be combined with natural language processing methods for entity recognition and relationship 
recognition. For existing specific response types, further extraction of hierarchical structures is needed when building ontologies to 
facilitate later knowledge graph searches, and this work needs to be done by domain experts, which is very time-consuming.
